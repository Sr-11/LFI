We FIX training set with 2n samples, and increase m to see when testing becomes crticallly possible.

One potential thing to think about is: what is n to choose from?

Files in this folder are organized as follows: independent functions in Data_gen.py takes in one argument n and spits out X, Y as 2n datas from two distributions to be specified. When called on -1 it returns the title string.

LFI trains functions with proper inputs.

Plot_from takes in input from data folder, which tracks the result and parameters from each run

TODOS:
Do something
